You’ve got this
One step at a time
Tiny progress is still progress
Finish what you started
Your future garden thanks you
Every task blooms a flower
Keep going, even slow is forward
Done is better than perfect
Grow through what you go through
You are closer than you think
Do the task. Get the coin. Buy the flower. Repeat.
Procrastinate now… but not today!
Your plant is judging you
That task won’t check itself off
Flowers are expensive. Better work.
Discipline grows dreams.
One click today, a garden tomorrow.
Tasks don’t vanish, but they do get done.
The most beautiful flowers bloom after effort.
Be proud of every checkbox.
